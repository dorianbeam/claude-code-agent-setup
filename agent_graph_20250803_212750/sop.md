- Email contains customer issue description, contact information, and potential attachments

## Expert Reasoning (25+ sentences)
The Customer Support Ticket Resolution process represents a complex workflow that requires seamless integration between multiple enterprise systems to achieve the target 80% automation rate. The process begins with email receipt which triggers customer identification through CRM lookup, a critical step that determines the entire workflow path based on customer tier and history. The classification phase requires sophisticated natural language processing to categorize issues into billing, technical, product, or refund categories, each potentially requiring different handling procedures and escalation paths.

Priority assessment represents a crucial decision point that combines customer tier information with issue severity analysis, where VIP customers receive preferential treatment with 1-hour response requirements versus 2-hour standard response times. The initial acknowledgment email serves dual purposes of customer communication and internal tracking initialization, requiring integration with both email systems and ticketing platforms. Issue analysis against the knowledge base represents a complex lookup operation that must match customer problems with existing solutions while considering company policies and procedures.

The resolution decision point creates the fundamental bifurcation in the workflow, where automatic resolution capability determines whether issues proceed through AI-powered resolution or human escalation paths. Automatic resolution requires sophisticated prompt engineering to generate appropriate responses that reference specific company policies while maintaining consistency with brand voice and legal requirements. The human escalation path involves complex routing logic based on issue categories, agent availability, and specialized skill requirements.

Customer record updates throughout the process require careful data management to maintain comprehensive audit trails while ensuring data consistency across multiple systems. Follow-up communications represent time-delayed workflow components that require scheduling and tracking mechanisms to ensure customer satisfaction monitoring. The closure process includes satisfaction measurement, manager review triggers for poor ratings, and comprehensive documentation requirements.

Business rules enforcement throughout the workflow requires constant validation of thresholds, priority assignments, and escalation criteria. The $500 refund threshold represents a critical business logic point that must be accurately implemented to prevent unauthorized financial approvals. VIP customer handling requires priority queue management and specialized routing to ensure service level agreement compliance.

The integration requirements span five distinct enterprise systems, each requiring specific authentication, data mapping, and error handling procedures. Salesforce integration must support complex customer data retrieval including order history, previous interactions, and customer tier classification. Email system integration requires bidirectional communication capabilities for both automated sending and receipt monitoring. Knowledge base integration must support semantic search capabilities to match customer issues with relevant documentation and policies.

Zendesk integration requires comprehensive ticket lifecycle management including creation, status updates, assignment, and closure tracking. Slack integration must provide real-time notification capabilities for human agents while supporting escalation queue management. The absence of these integrations creates significant operational gaps that prevent achieving the target automation levels and require manual intervention for all major workflow steps.

Error handling and exception management throughout the process require sophisticated retry mechanisms, timeout handling, and graceful degradation to manual processes when automated systems fail. The audit trail requirements necessitate comprehensive logging at each step to support compliance reporting and process optimization analysis. Performance monitoring must track response times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction metrics to ensure continuous process improvement.
