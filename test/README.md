## Files

### sample_process.md
A comprehensive customer support ticket resolution process that demonstrates:
- Multiple decision points and branching logic
- Integration with various SaaS systems (CRM, Email, Knowledge Base)
- Both automated and human-escalated paths
- Complex business rules and priority handling
- Follow-up and closure procedures

This process is ideal for testing the SOP generation system as it includes:
- **Integration Actions**: CRM lookups, email sending, ticket updates
- **Prompt Actions**: Content analysis, priority assessment, response generation
- **Decision Points**: Automatic vs. human resolution paths
- **Branching Logic**: Different paths based on customer tier and issue type
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Escalation scenarios requiring human intervention

## Usage

Use this sample process with the Agent Graph Generation System to:
1. Test SOP generation from business process descriptions
2. Validate node type classification (trigger, process, decision, etc.)
3. Verify tool matching for integration actions
4. Test prompt generation for AI-powered steps
5. Validate complete graph assembly with proper edge connections
