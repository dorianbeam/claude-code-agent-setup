## Process Description

### Overview
The Customer Support Ticket Resolution process begins when a customer submits a support request via email. The process involves ticket classification, response generation, issue resolution, and follow-up communication.

### Detailed Process Steps

1. **Ticket Receipt**: A customer sends an email to support@company.com with their issue
2. **Customer Lookup**: Search the CRM system using the customer's email address to retrieve their profile and order history
3. **Ticket Classification**: Analyze the email content to categorize the issue type (billing, technical, product, refund, etc.)
4. **Priority Assessment**: Determine ticket priority based on customer tier (VIP, regular) and issue severity
5. **Initial Response**: Send acknowledgment email to customer with ticket ID and expected response time
6. **Issue Analysis**: Review the customer's issue against our knowledge base and policies
7. **Resolution Decision**: Determine if the issue can be resolved automatically or requires human intervention
8. **Automatic Resolution Path**:
   - Generate resolution response based on company policies
   - Update customer record with resolution details
   - Send resolution email to customer
   - Mark ticket as resolved
9. **Human Escalation Path**:
   - Assign ticket to appropriate human agent based on issue category
   - Send internal notification to assigned agent
   - Update ticket status to "escalated"
10. **Follow-up**: After 48 hours, send follow-up email to check customer satisfaction
11. **Closure**: Close ticket if customer confirms resolution or no response after 7 days

### Business Rules
